# 🚀 JavaScript Fundamentals Projects  

This repository is a **collection of 30+ JavaScript projects** designed to strengthen my **core fundamentals** and build confidence in problem-solving with Vanilla JS.  

Each project covers essential JS concepts:  
- ✅ DOM Manipulation  
- ✅ Functions & Events  
- ✅ Arrays & Strings (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
- ✅ Timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`)  
- ✅ Async/Await & Fetch API  
- ✅ LocalStorage & CRUD Operations
